## Introduction

Hyperdrive is a hypermedia specification for representing entities.
Hyperdrive is intended to be generic specification extends existing JSON hypermedia sepcifications,
making them even more awesome, kind of like painting flames on a space ship. Hyperdrive adds a detailed
quote to each entity based on the HTTP Status Code that accurately describes the status. The existing
HTTP specification does an okay job describing status codes, but with Hyperdrive quotes, the process is
much more streamlined and awesome.
